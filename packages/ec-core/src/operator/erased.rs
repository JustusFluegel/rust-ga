/// Erased
/// ([dyn-compatible](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#dyn-compatibility))
/// version of the [`Operator`] trait
///
/// # How does this work?
///
/// The `erased` pattern in rust aids in type-erasure for traits
/// that aren't themselves dyn-compatible by declaring a dyn-compatible
/// extension trait wrapper for the original trait and blanket-implementing
/// that for all types which implement the original trait.
///
/// In this case, the trait [`DynOperator`] can be seen as a dyn-compatible
/// version of the [`Operator`] trait, and any `T: Operator` can also be
/// interpreted as [`T: DynOperator`]
///
/// This allows you to use `dyn DynOperator<I>` trait objects to perform type
/// erasure on types implementing the [`Operator`] trait.
///
/// # When to use it?
///
/// The original trait most of the time has a reason for not beeing
/// dyn-compatible. As such, usually the erased variants of traits come with
/// performance tradeoffs, and [`DynOperator`] is of course no exception either,
/// since it introduces additonal indirection and vtable-lookups.
///
/// Please prefer the [`Operator`] trait whenever possible.
///
/// # How to use it?
///
/// tl;dr: use `dyn DynOperator<>` instead of `dyn Operator<I>` and still use
/// all the usual [`Operator`] methods elsewhere.
///
/// This trait tries to provide some useful ergonomics to ease the interaction
/// with existing [`Operator`] code.
/// For example, many common pointer types in Rust pointing to a [`dyn
/// DynOperator<I>`](DynOperator) also implement the [`Operator`] trait
/// themselves, so you most likely do not need to interact with this trait
/// directly.
///
/// For example: `Box<dyn DynOperator<()>>` implements
/// [`Operator<()>`](Operator) and as such you can directly call
/// [`.apply()`](Operator::apply) on it and do not need to use
/// [`DynOperator::dyn_apply`].
///
/// This also means, any [`Box<dyn DynOperator<()>>`] can be passed to generic
/// functions expecting an [`Operator`], like `fn foo(t: impl Operator<()>);`.
