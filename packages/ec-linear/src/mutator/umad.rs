/// The UMAD mutation operator as described in
/// [the paper by T. Helmuth et al.](https://doi.org/10.1145/3205455.3205603)[^paper-ref]
///
/// The UMAD (Uniform Mutation by Addition and Deletion) operator acts
/// on variable length linear genomes, inserting new genes and deleting existing
/// genes in a random fashion.
///
/// New genes are generated using a user-provided `GeneGenerator`.
///
/// # Behavior
///
/// For each gene in the initial genome, a decision is made about
///
/// - Whether to keep or delete that gene, and
/// - Whether to insert a new gene, either to the existing gene's left or right.
///
/// Note that this can change the length of the genome, with the child
/// potentially being shorter or longer than the parent.
///
/// ## Parameters
///
/// There are several parameters which can be used to tune the mutation
/// operator:
///
/// - The addition rate, i.e., the likelihood of adding a new gene next to each
///   of the existing genes
/// - The deletion rate, i.e., the likelihood of deleting each gene in the
///   genome, including newly added genes
/// - The empty addition rate, i.e., the likelihood of adding a new gene when
///   the initial genome is empty. This is optional, and if it is not provided
///   then new genes will never be added to empty genomes. See below for further
///   discussion of this feature.
///
/// ## Balance
///
/// If the addition rate is much higher than the
/// deletion rate then the new genome is likely to be considerably
/// longer than the original genome. Similarly, if the deletion rate
/// is much higher than the addition rate then the genome is likely
/// to shrink.
///
/// If the deletion rate is set to `addition_rate / (1 + addition_rate)`,
/// then the expected length of the new child genome is the same as that of the
/// initial parent genome. The [`Umad::new_with_balanced_deletion`] constructor
/// sets the deletion rate according to this formula.
///
/// ## Differences from published UMAD definition
///
/// The one difference between this implementation and the published definition
/// is that we support the addition of a randomly generated gene if the initial
/// genome is empty. In the published definition, an empty genome would remain
/// empty. The likelihood of adding a gene to an empty genome is set by the
/// `empty_addition_rate` parameter; setting this to `None` will effectively
/// disable this feature, behaving the same as the published definition.
///
/// # Example
///
/// In this example we create an instance of `Umad` using [`Umad::new`] that
/// mutates vectors of characters.
///
/// ```
/// # use ec_core::{operator::mutator::Mutator, uniform_distribution_of};
/// # use ec_linear::{genome::vector::Vector, mutator::umad::Umad};
/// #
/// // Use a 30% chance of inserting a gene at each location.
/// let addition_rate = 0.3;
/// // Use a 30% chance of deleting each gene.
/// let deletion_rate = 0.3;
/// // This is our `GeneGenerator`, which will always just produce
/// // a character `x`.
/// let gene_generator = uniform_distribution_of!['x'];
///
/// // Create an instance of `Umad` using these parameters.
/// let umad = Umad::new(addition_rate, deletion_rate, gene_generator);
///
/// // Create a `Vec` of characters to use as a parent genome.
/// let parent_chars = "Mutate first, ask questions later.".chars().collect();
/// // Create a parent genome
/// let parent_genome = Vector {
///     genes: parent_chars,
/// };
///
/// // Mutate the parent genome to create a child genome
/// let child_genome = umad.mutate(parent_genome, &mut rand::rng()).unwrap();
/// ```
